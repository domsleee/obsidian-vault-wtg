Q1). The edoc example has 9 port pairs as the current behaviour - but the behaviour in alpha returns 13 port pairs (every combination with no restriction)

> 1. The Load port and Discharge Port of a Routing Leg with same Transport Mode as the Contract, the Carrier of the Routing Leg is blank or is the same as Service Provider of the Carrier Contract or is the same as the Linked Schedule Carrier of the Allocation.
2. The Load Port and Discharge Port of a Route Set (A Route Set that contains a Routing Leg with same Transport Mode as the Contract, the Carrier of that Routing Leg is blank or the same as Service Provider of the Carrier Contract)
Q2). The "contract" being referred to here is the contract of the resulting allocation routes in the search, correct? Or is it the contract of the current consol?
